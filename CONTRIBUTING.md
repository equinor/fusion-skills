# Contributing to Fusion Skills

Thank you for helping improve Fusion’s shared GitHub Copilot Agent Skills.

## Code of conduct

Contribute in a professional, inclusive, and respectful way. Assume good intent, communicate clearly, and keep feedback constructive.

We value contributions that are:
- clear and easy to review,
- scoped to one problem at a time,
- documented with enough context for maintainers.

## Security first

Do not expose secrets, credentials, or sensitive internal data in prompts, commits, issues, or documentation.

For vulnerability reporting, follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and Equinor CSIRT guidance:
- https://www.equinor.com/about-us/csirt

## Follow Equinor policies

Contributions must follow applicable Equinor policies, internal governance, and legal/compliance requirements.

If a contribution could have legal, compliance, data handling, or operational impact, align early with the relevant owner before merging.

## Pull request expectations

Before requesting review, make sure your PR is:
- focused and minimal,
- safe by default (no secret handling, no hidden side effects),
- Conventional Commit messages.
- clear about what changed and why.

If you are unsure about direction, open a draft PR early and ask for feedback.
