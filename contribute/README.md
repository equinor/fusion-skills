# Contribute Guide

👋 Welcome, builder of useful things.

You can absolutely YOLO a PR and hope for the best.
Or you can spend two minutes here and save everyone (including future-you) a lot of pain.

If you’re new, start with [Where to start](01-where-to-start.md). It helps you pick the right scope and where your change belongs.

## 🚀 A smooth path

Then follow this path:

- Shape the skill in [Skill structure and content](02-skill-structure-and-content.md)
- Make safety and behavior explicit in [Quality and safety](03-quality-and-safety.md)
- Add changeset/version context in [Versioning and release flow](04-versioning-and-release.md)
- Run local checks from [Validation and CI split](05-validation-and-ci.md)
- Confirm PR expectations in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

##  Working on scripts?

If your change touches automation in `scripts/`, read [Repository scripts and code rules](06-scripts-code-rules.md) before opening a PR.

Why? Script changes can break CI, release flow, or both — and nobody enjoys surprise archaeology in pipeline logs.
