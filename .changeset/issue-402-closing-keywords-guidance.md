"fusion-issue-authoring": patch
---

Clarify issue-closing keyword guidance across skill and contributor docs:

- align wording to keyword families (`fix|fixes|resolve|resolves|close|closes`)
- standardize direct issue reference examples (`owner/repo#123`)
- keep `Refs`/`Ref` as the default for non-closing references
