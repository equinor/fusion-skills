"fusion-skill-authoring": minor
---

Updates skill authoring defaults and metadata constraints to support complex repository-internal skill relationships.

Scope delivered:
- Permitted YAML arrays in frontmatter `metadata` specifically for modeling skill relationships (e.g., `metadata.sub_skills` or `metadata.required_skill`).
- Updated documentation and checklists to reflect the new versioning and metadata standards.
